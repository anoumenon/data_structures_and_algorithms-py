## DATA STRUCTURES


<a id="single_linked_list"></a>
### 1. single_linked_list <br>

### 2. stack <br>

Single direction linked list class for use as a stack.<br>

[link: code](https://github.com/jasonb315/data_structures_and_algorithms/tree/master/data_structures/stack)<br>

In stack.py:
Create a Class for a Stack which creates an empty Stack when instantiated
This class should be aware of a default None value assigned to top when the isntance is created
This class should be aware of the len of the stack, which represents the count of Nodes in the stack at any time
This class should have the ability to accept an iterable as an argument when instantiated, such as [1, 2, 3, 4], and creates a new Node in the stack for each value in the iterable
Define any further magic methods such as len and str to support user functionality and informative responses
Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance
Define a method called pop which takes no arguments and removes / returns the Node at the top of the stack
Define a method called peek which takes no arguments and returns the Node at the top of the stack

```python
def insert_above(self, val, target):
```
Insert a node of a val below to the L or R of a node with a target val
Children maintain branch side.
```python
def insert_below(self, val, target, side='L'):
```

<a id="binary_search_tree"></a>
### 5. binary_search_tree <br>

Brinary search tree.<br>

[link: code](https://github.com/jasonb315/data_structures_and_algorithms/tree/master/data_structures/binary_tree)<br>

This section is a binary search tree.
It organizes nodes in a binary structure from the root out.
Instantiation of a tree:
```python
acorn = BinaryTree()
```
Nodes are instantiated in val:data pairs.
Instantiation of a tree can be done with a list of iterables:
```python
oak = BinaryTree([(3, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (5, 'c')])
```
Or with a single, which is an iterable of one:
```python
sapling = BinaryTree([(8888, 'port')])
```
Additional inserts take one node at a time,
and are placed with binary logic by the integer val:
```python
def insert(self, val=None, data=None)

sapling.insert(315, 'new leaf')
```
