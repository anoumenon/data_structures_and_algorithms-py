### 2. insert_shift_arr <br>

>Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.<br>
>IN [4,8,15,23,42], 16<br>
>OUT [4,8,15,16,23,42]<br>
